# menubrain

### Stupidly Simple

MenuBrain is the info organizer I wanted someone else to make. It's stupidly simple. Once you launch MenuBrain, it will take up residence in your menubar and wait for you to put stuff in it. The items you add get put into the MenuBrain menu. When you select one, it gets copied to the clipboard -- or opened in a browser if it's a URL.

### Other nice features

Annotate: MenuBrain understands the colon. If you stick in "Jane's number: 555-123-4567," MenuBrain will copy the phone number (the stuff after the colon) and not "Jane's number" (the stuff before the colon) when you select it.

System Service: You can add text or URLs to MenuBrain from other apps using the Add to MenuBrain service.
